# Mahalanobis Classifier

Multiclass classifier based on Mahalanobis distance. 



You can read more on Mahalanobis distance here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance).




I got the original idea from this article https://www.machinelearningplus.com/statistics/mahalanobis-distance/ and extended their code to multiclass classification problems (original was for binary problems only).
